# Volcano 2
This is the source code for the game [Volcano 2 v 0.71](http://www.suomipelit.fi/pelit/20/Volcano+2) made by Tero Laitinen during 1999 - 2000.

In this release the source code from the game zip archive has been converted to UTF-8 encoding to make it compatible with modern compilers.

## Compilation
Compile with `make volcano`. 

Please note that you need `liballegro-4.2` and `mikmod` with the matching development packages to compile this. You also need the original game data with the file names converted to lower case to launch the game.

## License

An excerpt from `V2ENG.TXT` allows the use of source code for derivative projects.

>This version of Volcano 2 contains source codes and it is propably the last
>version that I will publish (if no new interest in game development occurs).
>The main reason for this is very old game engine. It lacks flexibility
>needed for new ideas and so development has stopped.
>
>One can develop game further and source codes are allowed to use freely
>in one's own projects as long as I am mentioned in the credits.
>Source codes are located in source.zip. You need DJGPP with Allegro and
>MikMod properly installed in order to compile Volcano 2.
