 1. The game

 Volcano 2 is an addictive action game for two or three players.
 The main idea of game is (suprise suprise!) to kill your enemies(players &
 bots). The elimination of enemies is best done with weapons.
 To be able to buy weapons you must collect lava.
 You must be near to your base in order to buy stuff.
 Screenshots can be taken by pressing F8.

 2. Recommended system   

  - Pentium 2 300 Mhz
  - 32 Mb ram.
  - Sound Blaster compatible or GUS sound card
  - Very very fast graphics adapter(AGP), which has VBE 2.0 or VBE 3.0
  - An old keyboard which allows many simultaneous keypresses without
    getting stuck

 4. Volcano 2's destiny

 This version of Volcano 2 contains source codes and it is propably the last
 version that I will publish (if no new interest in game development occurs).
 The main reason for this is very old game engine. It lacks flexibility
 needed for new ideas and so development has stopped.

 One can develop game further and source codes are allowed to use freely
 in one's own projects as long as I am mentioned in the credits.
 Source codes are located in source.zip. You need DJGPP with Allegro and
 MikMod properly installed in order to compile Volcano 2.
